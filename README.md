# The Job Portal
Hello there! 
I have created this full-stack web application using Core Java and Spring Framework. It encompasses features like adding a job and viewing the job list. I have released the first version of it so it contains very basic features as of now. 

TechStack used: Java, Spring Web, SpringBoot, Spring MVC, JSP, HTML5, CSS3, Apache Maven, Tomcat, Lombok.
